# RFID-DESFire #

Arduino library for MFRC522 and other RFID RC522 based modules.

This library extends the [MFRC522 library](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid) adding extra functionality for MIFARE DESFire cards.

At the current stage no crypto has been implemented and a very limited subset of commands are available.
